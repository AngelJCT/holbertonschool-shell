In this project we will be working and learning about I/O (Input/Output) Redirection and Filters.

The Linux operating system has the ability to change standard utput and standar input when executing a command.
Standar input refers to the keyboard and standar output to the display (screen).

Filters take standard input and perform an operation upon it and send the results to standard output.

Some of the commands that we will be working with are:
echo
cat
head
tail
find
wc
sort
uniq
grep
tr
rev
cut
