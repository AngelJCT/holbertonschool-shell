Shell Permissions

File permissions are use to control the access level that the system processes. Each file and directories is assigned access rights for the
owner of the file, the members of a group. besides being able to change permissions of a file or a directory and the ownership of it, controlingthe access is important to avoid unnecessary changes and errors in its content.
