# Shell Permissions

### File permissions are use to control the access level that the system processes. Each file and directories is assigned access rights for the owner of the file, the members of a group. besides being able to change permissions of a file or a directory and the ownership of it, controlingthe access is important to avoid unnecessary changes and errors in its content.
